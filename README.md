# plotly-visualizations-challenge
Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards

Given  [Navel Biology dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), created a number of plotly visualizations.

Repository contains the following:
* data/samples.json - study's dataset
* statis/js/app.js - Contains a function of each of the visulization sections (demographics, bar chart, bubble chart, gauge).  Contains an event handler for each of the dropdown lists and an init function to initalize the page with the 1st test subject's data.
* index.html - bootstrap page to display the visualizations from app.js
